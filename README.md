## 🌍 Overview

Self‑Healing Localization Layer (SHL) is a lightweight, dependency‑free Python library that eliminates missing translations forever.

It provides:
- Automatic creation of missing language files  
- Automatic creation of missing keys  
- Fallback to a base language (default: English)  
- Unified support for both UI text and AI prompt templates  

---

## ✨ Key Features

### ✔ Self‑healing UI localization  
- Missing language files are created automatically  
- Missing keys are added on the fly  
- Base language is used as fallback  

### ✔ Self‑healing AI prompt template localization  
- Missing template files are generated automatically  
- Base templates are copied as fallback  
- Missing template keys are added automatically  

### ✔ Unified high‑level engine  
The `LocalizationEngine` ties everything together:

- ensures languages exist  
- synchronizes all languages with the base language  
- provides clean access to UI text and templates  

### ✔ Zero dependencies  
Pure Python. Works everywhere.

## 📦 Installation

Currently available via TestPyPI (v0.1.3):

```bash
pip install --index-url [https://test.pypi.org/simple/](https://test.pypi.org/simple/) self-healing-localization==0.1.3
```

Self‑Healing Localization Layer (SHL) is a lightweight, dependency‑free Python library that eliminates missing translations forever.

It provides:

- automatic creation of missing language files  
- automatic creation of missing keys  
- fallback to a base language (default: English)  
- unified support for both UI text and AI prompt templates  
- optional AI‑powered translation (planned for v0.2)  

This library is designed to be **dropped into any project** — from small scripts to full applications — and it will maintain localization files automatically as the project grows.

No more manual JSON editing.  
No more “missing translation” errors.  
No more incomplete language packs.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Basic UI Localization
Initialize the engine and start retrieving text. If the key doesn't exist, it is added to your JSON files automatically.

```python
from shl.engine import LocalizationEngine

# Initialize the engine (e.g., set user language to Finnish)
engine = LocalizationEngine(lang_code="fi", base_lang="en")

# Retrieve UI text. If 'welcome_msg' is missing, it's created with the default value.
title = engine.ui_text("welcome_msg", "Welcome to the App!")

print(title)
```

### 2. Retrieve UI text

```python
title = engine.ui_text("app_title", "My Application")
```

If `"app_title"` does not exist in `locales/lang_en.json`, it will be added automatically.

### 3. Retrieve prompt templates

```python
summary_prompt = engine.template("summary_short", "Summarize the text:")
```

If `prompts/fi.json` does not exist, it will be created automatically using `prompts/en.json` as the base.

### 4. AI Prompt Templates
Keep your AI prompts localized just like your UI strings.

```python
# Retrieve a localized prompt template
prompt = engine.template("summarize_task", "Please summarize the following text:")
```

## 🧩 Project Structure
The library follows a modular design to keep the core logic separate from your application code:

```
self-healing-localization/
│
├─ shl/
│  └─ engine/                 # Core modular engine
│     ├─ core.py              # Main LocalizationEngine
│     ├─ localizer.py         # UI text logic
│     ├─ template_localizer.py # AI template logic
│     ├─ ai_translation.py    # (Coming in v0.2)
│     └─ __init__.py          # Internal package exports

├─ pyproject.toml             # Package configuration
└─ README.md                  # Project documentation
```

## 🔧 API Reference (v0.1)

### Initialize

```python
engine = LocalizationEngine(lang_code="en")
```

### UI text

```python
engine.ui_text(key, default="")
```

### Template text

```python
engine.template(key, default="")
```

### Ensure language exists

```python
engine.ensure_language("de")
```

### Sync all languages with base language

```python
engine.sync()
```
